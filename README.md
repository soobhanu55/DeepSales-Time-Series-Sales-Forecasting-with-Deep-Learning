# DeepSales: Time Series Sales Forecasting with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
DeepSales is a high-performance sales forecasting engine designed to predict total monthly product sales across multiple stores. Built on the "Predict Future Sales" dataset from Kaggle, the project addresses the complexities of real-world retail data, including fluctuating inventory and store lists.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Time Series Forecasting**: Leverages historical daily data to predict future monthly demand.
* **Robust Model Architecture**: Implements advanced Deep Learning models (CNN-LSTM) capable of handling non-stationary time series data.
* **Feature Engineering**: Includes sophisticated preprocessing to manage changing lists of shops and products over time.
* **Sequence Modeling**: Utilizes data reshaping into subsequences for optimized neural network training.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (CNN, LSTM).
* **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## 📊 Data Source
The model is trained on historical sales data from the [Kaggle Predict Future Sales Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).
